# Mutation-Testing
# Polynomial Operations in Python

This project provides a `Polynomial` class in Python that supports creating, evaluating, and performing various operations on polynomials, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finding roots using the bisection method. Additionally, this repository includes a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`.

## Features

- **Polynomial Representation**: Create polynomials using a list of coefficients.
- **String Representation**: View the polynomial in standard mathematical notation.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the polynomial at specific values of `x`.
- **Root Finding**: Locate roots of polynomials using the bisection method.
